This is a free, open-source, sample application demonstrating use of the
Asana API. It takes the form of a Chrome Extension that, when installed,
integrates Asana into your web experience in the following ways:

  * Creates a button in your button-bar which, when clicked, pops up a
    QuickAdd window to create a new task associated with the current web page.
    It will populate the task name with the page title by default, and
    put the URL in the notes, along with any text you may have selected
    when you pressed the button.

  * Installs the special Asana TAB+Q keyboard shortcut. When this key combo
    is pressed from any web page, it brings up the same popup.
